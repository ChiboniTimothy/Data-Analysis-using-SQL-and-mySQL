## Data Analysis using SQL and mySQL

- I worked on this project for a client, designing a database of different tables for a university, inserting data into all of the tables, and running advanced queries for analysis.

- Understanding the basics of databases was essential in order to complete this project, as well as being able to manipulate data within them by using SQL queries.
